To create a data visualization dashboard based on the given details, you can use various visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, and maps. Here are some suggestions for visualizing the variables and applying the filters:

Intensity, Likelihood, and Relevance can be visualized using bar charts or heatmaps to show the levels or scores.
Year can be visualized using a line chart or a slider to filter the data based on a specific year or a range of years.
Country, Region, and City can be visualized using a map to show the distribution or concentration of data across different locations.
Topics can be visualized using a word cloud or a treemap to display the frequency or importance of different topics.
Filters such as end year, topics, sector, region, PEST, source, and SWOT can be implemented using dropdown menus, checkboxes, or sliders to allow users to select or filter the data based on their preferences.
Remember to choose appropriate visualization techniques based on the nature of the data and the insights you want to convey.
